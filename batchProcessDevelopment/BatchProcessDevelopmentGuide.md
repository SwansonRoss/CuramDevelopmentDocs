A batch process in Curam allows a user to automate certain processes that may need to be run at scheduled interviews.

More information can be found in the [IBM Curam Docs](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-c%C3%BAram-social-program-management-pdf-library), specifically:

At a high level, the batch process takes a list of records, splits these records into several chunks, then records in a chunk are processed using one or more streams. Once the batch process is finished running, a report may be generated.
